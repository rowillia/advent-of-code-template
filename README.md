# 🎄 Advent of Code

## Usage

This works best inside of a VSCode Codespace or DevContainer.

1. (Optional) Set the environment variable `ADVENT_SESSION_COOKIE` to your adventofcode session cookie to automatically download your problem input. This can be found in the "Application > Storage > Cookies" section of the Chrome Developer Tools while visiting https://adventofcode.com .

1. (Optional) Set the environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to your Anthropic API key, you can find one at https://console.anthropic.com . This will be used to automatically parse the problem's test data (NOT to answer the question).

1. Generate the scaffolding for today's question
    ```bash
    aoc scaffold
    ```
1. If you didn't specify an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, paste the sample input and answer(s) into `examples/{year}/{day}.yaml`. For example:

    ```yaml
    input: |-
      A Y
      B X
      C Z
    answers:
    - 15
    - 12
    ```

Scaffolding will generate an empty solution file with 2 methods - `part1` and `part2`.

`aoc/solutions/{year}/day{day}.py`
```python
"""
--- Day X: Problem Title ---
"""
from aoc.utils.helpers import example_input, example_answer

year = 2024
day = 1

# Explore with example input
inp = example_input(year, day, part=1)
answer = example_answer(year, day, part=1)
print(f"Example input: {inp[:100]}...")
print(f"Expected answer: {answer}")

# %%
def part1(text: str) -> int | None:
    return None


# %%
def part2(text: str) -> int | None:
    return None
```

Unit Tests will be automatically generated based on the examples specified in the above yaml. Simply run:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Once you are satisfied with today's answer, generate your answer with:

```bash
aoc solve
```
