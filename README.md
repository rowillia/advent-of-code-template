# 🎄 Advent of Code

## Usage

This works best inside of a VSCode Codespace or locally with a DevContainer.

### (Optional) Environment Variables
1. (Optional) Set the environment variable `ADVENT_SESSION_COOKIE` to automatically download your problem input.  This can be find in the "Application > Storage > Cookies" section of the Chrome Developer Tools while visiting https://adventofcode.com .

1. (Optional) Set the environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to your Anthropic API key, you can find one at https://console.anthropic.com .  This will be used to automatically parse the example input from the problem (NOT to answer the question).

These can be configured as [Codespace Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-your-account-specific-secrets-for-github-codespaces) or stored in a local `.env` file (see `.env.example` for an example).

### Usage

1. Generate the scaffolding for today's question
    ```bash
    aoc scaffold
    ```
1. If you didn't specify an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, Paste the sample input and answer(s) into `examples/{year}/{day}.yaml`.  For example:

    ```yaml
    input: |-
    A Y
    B X
    C Z
    answers:
    - 15
    - 12
    ```

Scaffolding will generate an empty solution file with 2 methods - `part1` and `part2`.

`aoc/solutions/{year}/day{day}.py`
```python
"""
--- Day X: Problem Title ---
"""

def part1(text: str) -> int | None:
    return None


def part2(text: str) -> int | None:
    return None
```

Unit Tests will be automatically generated based on the examples specified in the above yaml.  Simply run:

```bash
pytest .
```

By default tests only run for the current year, but we can force tests for all years to run with:

```
ADVENT_RUN_ALL_TESTS=True pytest .
```

Once you are satisfied with today's answer, generate your answer with:

```bash
aoc solve
```
